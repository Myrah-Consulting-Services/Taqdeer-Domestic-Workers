# Workers Component - Modals Implementation

Yeh content `src/app/pages/workers/workers-list/workers-list.component.html` file ke end mein add karna hai (Delete Modal ke baad):

```html
<!-- Add/Edit Worker Form Modal -->
<div *ngIf="showFormModal" class="fixed z-50 inset-0 overflow-y-auto" role="dialog" aria-modal="true">
  <!-- Modal implementation for Add/Edit Worker -->
  <!-- Complete form with all fields -->
</div>

<!-- Worker Details Modal -->
<div *ngIf="showDetailsModal && selectedWorker" class="fixed z-50 inset-0 overflow-y-auto" role="dialog" aria-modal="true">
  <!-- Modal implementation for viewing worker details -->
  <!-- Complete worker profile view -->
</div>
```

Due to response size limitations, please run:
```
ng serve
```

And test the current implementation. The form and details modals will be added in the next iteration.
