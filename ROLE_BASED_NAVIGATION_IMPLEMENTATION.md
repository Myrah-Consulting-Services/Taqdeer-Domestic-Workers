## Implementation Details

### Header Component Updates

2. **Permission-Based Navigation:** Navigation items shown based on user permissions
3. **Mobile Responsive:** Role-based navigation works on both desktop and mobile
4. **User Role Display:** Shows specific employee role in user dropdown

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Navigation:** Navigation changes based on logged-in user's role
- **Permission-Based Access:** Each navigation item respects user permissions
- **Responsive Design:** Works on all device sizes
- **Role-Specific Branding:** User dropdown shows specific role (e.g., "Operations Manager", "Sales Executive")

## Business Requirements Alignment

### TAQDEER Meeting Requirements
✅ **Operations Team:** Can view sales, invoices, worker availability, and current status  
✅ **Receptionist:** Can add worker details (basic information)  
✅ **Role-Based Access:** System access limited to appropriate users  
✅ **Employee Management:** HR Manager can manage internal employees  
✅ **Financial Access:** Accountant has full financial module access  

### Navigation Logic
- **Operations Manager:** Full operational view with all modules except finance
- **Sales Executive:** Sales-focused with worker and sponsor management
- **Accountant:** Financial oversight with access to all modules
- **HR Manager:** Employee and worker management focus
- **Receptionist:** Basic operational access for front-desk tasks

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `src/app/components/header/header.component.ts` - Added role detection methods
2. `src/app/components/header/header.component.html` - Updated navigation structure
3. `src/app/models/user.model.ts` - Employee role permissions already defined
4. `src/app/services/auth.service.ts` - Authentication system supports employee roles

### Role Detection Methods
```typescript
get isOperationsManager(): boolean
get isSalesExecutive(): boolean  
get isAccountant(): boolean
get isHRManager(): boolean
get isReceptionist(): boolean
```

### Permission Checks
```typescript
get canViewSales(): boolean
get canViewAccountsFinance(): boolean
get canViewEmployees(): boolean
get canViewSponsors(): boolean
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Cases
1. **Operations Manager Login:** Should see Agents, Workers, Sponsors, Sales, Employees
2. **Sales Executive Login:** Should see Agents, Workers, Sponsors, Sales
3. **Accountant Login:** Should see all modules including Accounts & Finance
4. **HR Manager Login:** Should see Workers, Sponsors, Employees
5. **Receptionist Login:** Should see only Workers, Sponsors
6. **Agent Login:** Should see only "My Workers"
7. **Admin Login:** Should see all modules

## Security Considerations

- **Permission-Based Access:** Each navigation item respects user permissions
- **Role Validation:** User roles are validated through the authentication service
- **Route Protection:** Navigation items only show if user has appropriate permissions
- **Session Management:** Role information persists across browser sessions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Permissions:** Ability to modify user permissions without code changes
2. **Role Hierarchy:** Support for role inheritance and delegation
3. **Audit Logging:** Track navigation and access patterns
4. **Custom Navigation:** Allow users to customize their navigation preferences
