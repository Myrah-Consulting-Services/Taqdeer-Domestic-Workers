## üîÑ Return, Refund & Replacement

### Return Within Trial Period (First 6 months):
Sponsor can:
1. **Select Another Worker** (Replacement)
2. **Request Refund** (Proportional calculation)

### Refund Calculation Formula:
```
Monthly Rate = Total Amount √∑ 24 months
Amount for Worked Period = Monthly Rate √ó Months Worked
Refundable Amount = Total Amount - Amount for Worked Period
```

### Full Refund Cases:
- Worker Illness
- Worker Pregnancy
- Worker Absconded

**Example Calculation:**
```
Worker: Ethiopia (AED 5,000)
Contract: 24 months
Worked: 2 months

Monthly Rate = 5,000 √∑ 24 = AED 208.33
Amount for 2 months = 208.33 √ó 2 = AED 416.66
Refundable Amount = 5,000 - 416.66 = AED 4,583.34
```
